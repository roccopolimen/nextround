## Description

With COVID-19 and job recruitment transitioning over to the internet, managing job applications and their progress has become much more stressful. Remembering which positions you have applied for, monitoring upcoming events, and tracking your application progress can easily pile up and become overwhelming if not well managed. Additionally, many employees want to maintain a competitive salary and consequently re-enter the hiring cycle as short as every two to three years. NextRound will help users manage, organize, and evaluate their job applications per cycle.
